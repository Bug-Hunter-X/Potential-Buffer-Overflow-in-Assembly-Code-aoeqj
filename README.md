This repository demonstrates a common vulnerability in assembly code: a potential buffer overflow. The `bug.asm` file contains the vulnerable code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version with bounds checking.  Understanding this vulnerability is crucial for writing secure assembly programs. The issue arises from the lack of checks to ensure that the memory access is within the bounds of the allocated buffer.   This could allow an attacker to manipulate program execution and potentially compromise system security.
